					I am a graduate researcher at the Smart Textiles and Nanotechnology Research Group at Colorado State University, focusing on integrating machine learning into innovative biosensing technologies. My thesis centers on developing a flexible antibiotic-loaded colorimetric biosensor that detects environmental stimuli such as pH changes, temperature variations, and bacterial presence.

By leveraging machine learning algorithms, I analyze colorimetric responses from polydiacetylenes (PDAs) embedded in electrospun nanofibers. This integration enhances real-time data interpretation, enabling rapid identification of health and environmental conditions.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Textile Engineering from Khulna University of Engineering & Technology, where I explored Triboelectric Nanogenerators. My ultimate ambition is to contribute to the development of space suits, and I am dedicated to expanding my expertise in textile science and machine learning to achieve this goal.

				<h2 style="margin: 0;">Application of green technology to treat fibrous (textile) waste and recycling of used chemicals for reutilization of similar waste</h2>
				<p style="margin: 10px 0;">Industrial factories, especially textile mills, usually release untreated waste into the environment. These textile industries produce large volumes of waste that harms the environment and humans. Waste treatment procedures are expensive. However, foreign buyers choose companies with waste-treatment facilities or ecologically friendly methods. In this study, color was extracted from discarded textile fibers using colorimetric analysis, and then synthetic fiber components were recycled using eco-friendly processes and materials. There was also an evaluation of the regenerated chemicals' ability to treat analogous garbage. Samples processed with both new and recycled chemicals were found to be free of color and synthetic components, providing strong evidence that the recycled chemicals are just as effective. The treated materials passed safety testing showing no traces of Azo or Formaldehyde. As a result of the waste treatment process, the samples were in an appropriate state, having lost their color and all synthetic components. Because their physico-mechanical qualities were not altered by the treatment, the samples may be safely discharged into the environment or used as a raw material in the textile industry's spinning division to make fresh yarn. Chemicals originally used to treat fibrous debris were recycled and put to good use in a circular process that saved money in the long run. The method used to treat textile industry fiber waste is feasible for widespread implementation, which is both practical and helpful in the fight against environmental degradation.</p>

				<h2 style="margin: 0;">Evaluation of physico-mechanical properties of naturally dyed betel-nut leaf plate (BLPF)–Banana blended fabric</h2>
				<p style="margin: 10px 0;">Betel-nut leaf plate fiber (BLPF) is a lingo-cellulosic natural fiber that can be used to make eco-friendly and biodegradable blended or hybrid fabric with Banana fiber. In the world of organic textiles, naturally dyed BLPF-Banana fiber can be used for wearable products and satisfy health and hygiene issues. BLPF and Banana fiber can be good natural fibers for hybrid fabrics despite being considered waste materials. In this research work, both of the fibers were pretreated carefully to get the desired fineness, color, flexibilities, etc., which are necessary to manufacture fabric. BLPF-Banana woven (1 × 1) hybrid fabric was developed where 12 Ne Banana yarns were used in the warp direction, and 20 Ne BLPF yarns were used in the weft direction and it was dyed naturally with Turmeric. Evaluations of different physico-mechanical properties; tensile strength (854.9 N), tearing strength (14.5 N), stiffness (3.1 N), crease recovery (75° angle), and fabric thickness (1.33 mm) of naturally dyed BLPF-Banana blended fabric were tested, and found satisfactory. SEM, FTIR, and Water vapor transmission tests were also conducted in this study. It attempted to turn the wastages into an asset to make a unique biodegradable BLPF-Banana hybrid fabric by blending two types of natural fibers with the help of natural dyeing substance; it could be a good replacement for synthetic blended fabric.</p>

				<h2 style="margin: 0;">Surface modification of naturally dyed jute fabric to ameliorate its multifunctional properties and electrical conductivity</h2>
				<p style="margin: 10px 0;">Jute is a natural long-staple fiber, but its mechanical strength and conductivity are insufficient for high-performance fiber. To improve the multifunctional properties, naturally dyed jute fabric was grafted with EMA monomer and reduced graphene oxide. The treated jute sample performed well in multifunctional tests where higher amount of EMA improved tensile and tear strength to 88.27% and 164.02%. Treated jute fabric had a higher current flow and lower resistivity than untreated jute. The naturally dyed jute fabric had good color quality, and the treated sample's water vapor transfer rate was lower, indicating a more compact structure. This naturally colored treated jute fabric can replace traditional jute when low to medium strength and low water vapor transmission are needed. It was the first attempt to employ EMA to achieve multifunctional properties on naturally colored jute fabric, and it could be applied everywhere 1.51 mA current is required to flow naturally.</p>

				<h2 style="margin: 0;">Development of recycled natural fiber based composite material by hand lay-up process and analysis of its acoustic & physical properties</h2>
				<p style="margin: 10px 0;">This research mainly characterizes a unique property of both jute and coir fiber composites. The target of the paper was to justify that unique characteristic, which featured to be the sound absorption quality of those two fiber composites. The composites involved jute and coir fibers as reinforcement and epoxy resin as polymer matrix. The analysis of the binding capability of epoxy resin and its ability to provide net shape to the composites was also an important concern for this paper. Composites of both 100% jute and coir fiber and hybrid composites of different compositions of both fibers were the elements which had gone through the sound absorption test. The proper identification of the chemical composition of the fibers and the realization of the effect of silica gel coating applied on two of the pretreated fiber samples were also some of the distinctive facts and FTIR was performed to examine that. The strength of the composites was also observed. The outcome of the sound absorption test included that, the value of the sound absorption co-efficient changed with the variety in percentage of the fibers present. There also lied a significant difference in sound absorption quality of both the pure fiber composites.</p>

				<h2 style="margin: 0;">Physico-mechanical properties of naturally dyed jute-banana hybrid fabrics</h2>
				<p style="margin: 10px 0;">Ligno-cellulosic natural fiber like Banana can be acclimated to manufacture hybrid or union fabric with mostly used jute fiber which can get colossal popularity as a wearable product because of the health and hygiene issues. Banana fibers, extracted from the sheath, can be utilized for manufacturing fiber, can diminish the pressure on the jute fiber. It will be very frugal, and ineluctably it will be a great opportunity to blend it with the other natural fiber. In this study, a Jute-Banana hybrid fabric (JBHF) was developed by using Jute yarn (12 Ne, in warp) and Banana yarn (18 Ne, in weft). In order to evaluate physico- mechanical properties of naturally dyed Jute-Banana hybrid fabric, different tests like Stiffness, Thickness, Tensile strength, Tear strength, Drape and Crease recovery were conducted which provided satisfactory results. Colorfastness to wash, water, rubbing and perspiration of naturally dyed Jute-Banana hybrid fabrics (JBHF) also provided acceptable outcomes. FTIR test also provided the confirmation of this two fibers and Spectrophotometer was used to illustrate the dyeing quality. It was an endeavor to minimize the dependency on a single quality fiber and find an alternative way to prepare the hybrid fabric by blending two different quality natural fibers.</p>

				<h2 style="margin: 0;">Development of biodegradable plastics from potato starch with enhanced physico-mechanical properties comparative to the regular plastic</h2>
				<p style="margin: 10px 0;">Plastic'sversatility and adaptability have made it a common household item in almost every country. Plastic, on the other hand, is a non-biodegradable commodity that has sparked environmental worries, prompting a quest for "green" alternatives, with starch being the top runner due to its abundance and low cost. Physico-mechanical qualities such as tensile strength, tear strength, stiffness, elongation at break, and moisture stability are all poor in starch-based materials. Through starch modification, reinforcements (both organic and inorganic), processing conditions, and the use of compatibilizers, a biodegradable plastic with increased physico-mechanical properties is being generated from potato starch to develop alternatives for traditional plastics in this study. Further research has been carried out to compare the physico-mechanical properties of biodegradable plastics to regular plastics. Test results showed a very promising start for the biodegradable plastic for becoming the alternative of regular non-biodegradable plastics.</p>

				<h2 style="margin: 0;">An approach to improve the pilling resistance properties of three thread polyester cotton blended fleece fabric</h2>
				<p style="margin: 10px 0;">Pilling is a common surface defect in fleece fabrics made of chief value cotton (CVC) and polyester cotton (PC). The term “Chief Value Cotton” refers to fabrics produced by mixing cotton and synthetic fiber such as polyester where cotton typically makes up more than half of the overall combination of polyester. Customers nowadays want polyester cotton blended fleece fabric with excellent pilling resistance, but it is difficult to improve pilling properties in polyester cotton blended fleece fabric. A variety of studies have been conducted to improve the pilling properties of single jersey CVC knit fabric. The primary goal of this study is to eliminate pilling in fleece fabrics made of three-thread polyester cotton blends. In this analysis, singeing with a heat setting was used to increase pilling resistance. According to this experimental study, the pilling resistance properties improve from grade 1 to grade 4, which is extraordinary. This method can be used to successfully solve the pilling problem in three thread polyester cotton blended fleece fabrics in the textile knitting industry.</p>

				<h2 style="margin: 0;">Selection of suitable knitting parameters for 1 x 1 rib collar manufacturing in V-bed knitting machine</h2>
				<p style="margin: 10px 0;">The main components of a polo shirt are the body and collar. For different body measurements, different collar sizes are needed. It is very crucial to select the perfect collar size according to body size; otherwise, collar size will be larger or smaller than the required size. However, producing and maintaining perfect collar size concerning body size is very tough as the collar is tiny. If the finished collar size is larger or smaller than the appropriate size, the manufacturer is supposed attach the incorrectly measured collar to the body, placing the customer at risk of a vital quality argument. Otherwise, the manufacturer would have to remake the collar, wasting both time and money. Sometimes, the knitting industry has to deal with purchase order cancellations due to a lack of lead time for replication. To avoid the complexities described earlier, quantitative equations for collar production based on the number of ply, stitch duration, and needle count were established in this study. The precision of this exploration work is approximately 100 percent for matching exact collar size with body size. As a result, the evolved technique can be used in the textile knitting industry to ensure that accurate specifications are met the first time.</p>

				<h2 style="margin: 0;"> A Survey-Based Study on Physiological Health Condition & Socioeconomic Crises of the Rmg Sector Workers of Bangladesh During Covid-19 Pandemic</h2>
				<p style="margin: 10px 0;">COVID-19 or also known as SARS-CoV-2 respiratory virus is currently showing its devastating affect not only on the public health but also on the world economy as well. Many developed countries like USA, Russia, Italy and France have struggled to face this pandemic. Developing and underdeveloped countries are also going through economical and financial crises as well as the sever break down in public health sector. Over the past several months, the world has witnessed how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the textile sectors of Bangladesh in various unprecedented ways. The objective of this study is to assess the potential impact of the coronavirus disease on the textile workers of Bangladesh. This study articulates the garments workers existing vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic. A pre-determined questionnaire has been used to evaluate the current deplorable condition of the garment workers. The information was collected from workers in various industries. The paper outlines the existing supports the workers have found during the pandemic situation from the textile industries they worked in. COVID-19 has already affected both the physical and mental health of garment workers and has resulted in reduced employment. Textile factory stakeholders should pay close attention to the health and overall well-being of workers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

				<h2 style="margin: 0;"> Utilization of prawn to reduce the value of BOD and COD of textile wastewater.</h2> 
			    <p style="margin: 10px 0;"> In the textile sector especially in the wet processing area, a large quantity of water is utilized together with specific chemicals for raw material processing. If the wastewater after the chemical treatment is directly discharged to the environment, it is hazardous for the living organism and also the aquatic life of nature. In this study, the cephalothorax and abdomen shell of the prawn was processed to obtain chitosan and the textile wastewater was treated with the obtained chitosan to reduce the value of biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The reduction rate of BOD, COD was significant, and in the acceptable range of discharge water quality. In order to compare the performance of prawn shell treatment, similar untreated wastewater was treated separately by using the microorganism. The reduction of BOD and COD was analyzed differently for both microorganisms and prawn shell treatment which indicated the superiority in the reduction of BOD and COD of wastewater by using prawn shell treatment. The traditional process used in the purpose of wastewater treatment could be upgraded by using the naturally obtained chitosan which could also be easily applicable at a low cost. The used convenient procedure to obtain chitosan from prawn and to apply chitosan to reduce the value of BOD and COD could be efficacious in the new era to treat wastewater naturally, effectively.</p>

			   <h2 style= 'margin :00 ;' >Surface modification and qualitative natural coloring of raw jute to reduce electrical resistance and induce anti-microbial properties </h2 > 
			   <p style= 'margin :10 px ;'>Jute is a natural cellulosic fiber. Due to its natural traits, jute has a high proclivity to be attracted by microorganisms which degrade the longevity as well as quality. Considering the electrical properties, raw jute has a high proportion of electrical resistance and customarily the useable form of jute is undyed. In this study, the raw jute was chemically processed as well as dyed by utilizing natural ingredients. The electrical resistance of the processed jute was lessened significantly ascertained by electronic mega ohm meter. Due to the treatment of raw jute, the processed jute became adaptable to pass more electron through it which consequently incremented the gettable current. The processed jute was able to attain antimicrobial activity which positively influenced its longevity and the dyeing quality was also satisfactory. Colorfastness to rubbing rating of the dyed jute was excellent in greyscale for dry as well as wet rubbing. Processed jute with less electrical resistance in comparison to raw jute together with the newly attainment of antimicrobial activity can be utilized in the electrical field as well as conductive textiles with high longevity and decorative as well due to its colorization. No possibility of azo and formaldehyde contamination during natural colorization which has been a great concern for synthetic dyes. The incipiently integrated multifunctional characteristics of the jute would be felicitous to regard the processed jute as the supplanting of the traditional electrical instrument used for milliampere level of current conductivity purpose. </p >

			   <h2 style= 'margin :00 ;' >Surface modification of ligno-cellulosic fiber(jute)to increase electrical conductivity </h2 > 
				<p style= 'margin :10 px ;' >Jute fiber is one of the most convenient lingo-cellulosic natural fibers in South Asia like India and Bangladesh. Though jute has lots of end uses, among them raw jute can also be used and processed to convey electrical conductivity by chemically changing the surface properties of raw jute. The resistance shown on the surface of raw jute fiber is relatively high. The chemical modification done on the raw jute lessens its surface resistance. The impetus of this study is to explain the concept of minimizing the surface resistance of jute fiber. But the compact structure of jute makes the surface more impenetrable to convey conductivity. After the modification the surface becomes susceptible to be porous and also less resistive. This proclivity of being low resistive can be used as low to medium voltage insulator along with being a conductive material where lower current is required to flow. Now-a-days, traditional jute production is competing globally. In that respect the implication of raw jute can be both financially dead-lock breaking incident & also the aspect of emerging towards a new dawn.</p>
